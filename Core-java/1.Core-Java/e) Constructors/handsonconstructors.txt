Pragrammer needs to know how to use Constructor
-------------------------------------------------------------

1. develop class Emp inside package called com.cts.vms with instance variable
empno--->int
ename--->String
sal--->int
type--->String 


2. develop default constructor in side Emp class which is used to intialize values to the variables like this
empno--->10
ename--->"abc"
sal---->50000
type----->permanent
 
so whenever you are creating object by using defalut constructor those values will be intialized.


3. from above constructor we cannot use everytime. so now we are going to create parameterized constructor to intialize all instance variables
so create parameterized constructor, it should have all instance variable. 

use this keyword to intialize all values


4. create display method inside Emp class which is used to print message on the console like this
"emp name is "+ename+" sal is "+sal


5. create ExEmp class(Execution class) in the same package with main method

testcase 1:
----------
create two objects of Emp with default constructor and call display method 

note: here we are getting same values for two Emp objects

testcase 2:
-----------
create two objects of Emp with parameterized constructor(pass differnet values) and call display method


note: here we are getting different values for two Emp objects
