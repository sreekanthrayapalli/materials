1. a.create user defined exception name is  LoginException
   b.Create class ValidateUser which is having a method named      checkUser(String username,String password) which returns         boolean value.
   c. if username is "admin" and password is "admin123" then           checkUser method returns true otherwise returns false.
   d. if username or password is null then raise an exception       Named LoginException and it should give user-friendly       message username or password should not be null.



2)a)create User-defined Exception named PasswordException
    b)create class ValidPassword which having a method named validatePassword(String password)
   c)if password length is greater than 6 characters and less then 10 characters and it should contain 1 numberic and 1 special symbol then print Valid password else throw ValidPassword Excpetion
    d)create execution logic named(PasswordEx) test validatePassword method



3. Develop a simple java application to calculate the tax for a particular employee based on his salary.

Develop  a  class  named  “TaxCalculator“ with a method named calculateTax with the following method parameters,

Variable Name	Data Type
empName	String
isIndian	                 boolean
empSal	                 double

This method should return a double taxAmount.

The business logic for calculating the tax  is as follows, this has to be implemented inside the method,

If the employee is not a Indian
   The calculator should throw a CountryNotValidException

If the employee name is null or empty
   The calculator should throw a EmployeeNameInvalidException

If  empSal is greater than one lakh and isIndian true
taxAmount =empSal *8/100 
Otherwise  If  empSal  is between 50K and 1lakh and isIndian true
taxAmount =empSal *6/100 
Otherwise  If  empSal  is between 30 and 50 Thousand  and isIndian true
taxAmount =empSal *5/100 
Otherwise  If  empSal  is between 10 and 30 Thousand  and isIndian true
 taxAmount =empSal *4/100 
Otherwise
   The calculator should throw a TaxNotEligibleException. 

Develop a main class CalculatorSimulator  , implement the following logic in main method

i.	Execute the calculateTax Method and print the tax amount as “Tax amount is “<Tax Amount>

ii.	In case the calculateTaxMethod throws exceptions, this method needs to catch the appropriate exception print the stack trace and display the following messages,

a.	Country not valid:  “The employee should be an Indian citizen for calculating tax”

b.	Employee name not valid:  “The employee name cannot be empty”

c.	Not eligible for Tax calculation:  “The employee does not need to pay tax”
