1)

create ArrayList and store values 1-100000
create  thread class(thread1) and create two objects for that, one thread object has to display 
even numbers, other thread has to display odd numbers. 

find time difference in this program with threads and without threads






2)producer-consumer problem
------------------------------------
steps
-----
a)Generator class is having two methods(normal class)
    int a;
   boolean flag=true/false
   i)put method
   ii)get method

b)Produrcer is accessing put method(thread class)

c)Consumer is accessing get method(thread class)

d)Execution logic create one Generator object, two threads call start methods


3)Chating application
----------------------------
String []ram ={"hi","how are you","i m fine"};
String []raj = {"hi","i am fine what about you"};

display these message properly implement by using producer-consumer problem
