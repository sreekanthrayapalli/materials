1. Given a List of words from a book.
Determine the Cost of printing that book depending on following conditions
if any word occurs only once then that word costs $1
if any word occurs >= 2 times and <=5 times then that word costs $2
if any word occurs >= 6 times and <=10 times then that word costs $3
if any word occurs >10 times then the algorithm to calculate is
  Ex: 22 times => 10 times + 10 times + 2 times = $3 + $3 + $2 = $8
hello-->2
ok -->5
java--->10
good-->1

4+10+30+1==>45


2. assume that hr is having 100 resumes, some resumes contains java word,some other resume contains hadoop , some both , you have to pick the resumes which contains hadoop and java

3. compare excel values and jdbc values

4. write a program to implement copy functinality (i.e read data from file and write same data into other file in different location)

5. create employee class by implementing Serializable interface with getters and setters methods
     create List object and save 10 employee objects
     create a file and store list(10 employees)  hint: use Serializable concept

     read all employee data from file and display data in sorted order of employee name
